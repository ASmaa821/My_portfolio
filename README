# Board Games Data Cleaning and Analysis Project

## Project Objective
This project aims to work with real-world board games data by cleaning and analyzing it using Python. Raw, unclean data is transformed into analyzable data, then relationships between variables are explored to understand user behavior and game ratings.

## Project Contents

- Data Cleaning: Using the Pandas library to remove missing values, drop unnecessary columns, and correct data types.
- Data Analysis: Utilizing visualization tools such as Seaborn and Matplotlib to discover patterns and relationships.
- Visualizations: Including Histograms, Heatmaps, Pairplots, and more.
- Insights Extraction: Examining the impact of the number of reviews on game ratings and the distribution of ratings among games.
