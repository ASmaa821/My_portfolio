## **2️⃣ Data Overview**

The dataset contains **11 columns**:

| Column         | Description                          |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| id             | Unique property ID                   |
| title          | Property title / description         |
| displayAddress | Full address of the property         |
| bathrooms      | Number of bathrooms (constant: 2)    |
| bedrooms       | Number of bedrooms                   |
| addedOn        | Date property was listed             |
| type           | Buy/Sell                             |
| rera           | RERA developer ID                    |
| propertyType   | Apartment, Villa, etc.               |
| price          | Property price in AED                |
| city           | Extracted city from `displayAddress` |
| area           | Extracted area from `displayAddress` |

**Observations:**

* All properties have **2 bathrooms**, so bathrooms do not impact price correlation
* Prices range from **233,000 AED to over 14,500,000 AED**
* Dataset covers multiple cities and areas for comprehensive analysis

---

## **3️⃣ Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering**

* Converted `price` to integer for calculations
* Extracted `city` and `area` from `displayAddress`
* Created **Price Ranges** for market segmentation:

  * `<500k`, `500k-1M`, `1M-2M`, `2M-5M`, `>5M` AED

---

## **4️⃣ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

### **4.1 Price vs Number of Bedrooms**

* **Finding:** Average property prices increase with the number of bedrooms
* **Visual:** Heatmap

```python
city_bedrooms_price = df.groupby(['city','bedrooms'])['price'].mean().unstack()
sns.heatmap(city_bedrooms_price, annot=True, fmt=".0f", cmap="YlGnBu")
```

---

### **4.2 Price Distribution per City**

* **Finding:** Dubai has the highest concentration of expensive properties; Sharjah and Ajman have more affordable properties
* **Visual:** Boxplot

```python
sns.boxplot(x='city', y='price', data=df)
```

---

### **4.3 Top Areas by Total Property Value**

* **Finding:** Highest total property value in areas:

  * Downtown Dubai, Dubai Hills Estate, Sobha Hartland
* **Visual:** Bar chart

```python
top_areas = df.groupby('area')['price'].sum().sort_values(ascending=False).head(10)
top_areas.plot(kind='bar', color='orange')
```

---

### **4.4 Price Range Distribution per City**

* **Finding:** Market segmentation is visible; Dubai dominates the >2M AED segment
* **Visual:** Stacked Bar Chart

```python
price_city = pd.crosstab(df['city'], df['price_range'])
price_city.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, colormap='viridis')
```

---

### **4.5 Bedroom Distribution per City**

* **Finding:** Most properties are **2–3 bedrooms**; smaller cities have fewer large apartments
* **Visual:** Stacked Bar Chart

```python
bedrooms_city = pd.crosstab(df['city'], df['bedrooms'])
bedrooms_city.plot(kind='bar', stacked=True, colormap='coolwarm')
```

---

## **5️⃣ Key Insights**

1. **Price vs Bedrooms:** More bedrooms → higher price
2. **City Effect:** Dubai is the most expensive city; Ajman & Sharjah more affordable
3. **Top Areas:** Downtown Dubai, Dubai Hills Estate, Sobha Hartland have highest property values
4. **Price Ranges:** Most properties fall in `500k-2M AED`; luxury segment >5M is smaller but concentrated in Dubai
5. **Bathroom Count:** Constant (2), so no correlation with price
6. **Market Segmentation:** Clear distinction between affordable, mid-range, and luxury segments

---

## **6️⃣ Tools & Skills Applied**

* **Python & Pandas:** Data cleaning, grouping, pivot tables
* **NumPy:** Numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn:** Data visualization (Heatmaps, Boxplots, Bar charts)
* **EDA & Insights Generation:** Understand market trends, top areas, and price segmentation

---
