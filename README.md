# Board Games Data Cleaning and Analysis

## Overview
This project focuses on cleaning and analyzing a dataset related to board games. The goal is to extract meaningful insights by performing data preprocessing, handling outliers, and visualizing patterns and correlations in the dataset.

## Objectives
- Clean the dataset by removing irrelevant or null values
- Handle outliers to ensure accurate analysis
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and relationships
- Draw insights about game ratings and popularity

## Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn

## Key Steps Performed
1. Loaded the dataset and performed an initial inspection
2. Dropped unnecessary columns and handled missing values
3. Filtered out records with zero user ratings
4. Visualized the distribution of ratings and number of users
5. Explored the relationship between rating and other features like year published and number of ratings
6. Identified and examined outliers
7. Summarized findings and observations

## Results & Insights
- A clear positive correlation between number of user ratings and average rating
- Modern games (recently published) tend to have better ratings
- Data cleaning significantly improved the reliability of the insights
- Outliers include both errors and valuable entries like highly-rated games

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates fundamental data analysis skills, including cleaning, handling outliers, and visualizing data. It serves as an entry-level portfolio piece for data analytics using Python.
